<p>Some time in April, I decided to teach myself Ruby as part of a greater goal:
learning enough skills to give myself a shot at App Academy.  I set myself a
curriculum, bought a bunch of notebooks and pens, and got to work. </p>
<a href="curriculum.html">Curriculum</a>

<p>So far, it's been an extraordinary challenge.  It feels pretentious to call 
my prior programming experience 'exposure', as I don't recall doing much more
challenging than 'Hello World', and that in C++, while playing around on 
someone else's computer.  However, it seems I remembered at least a little bit
of it, as I found ruby to be rather readable.</p>

<p>The learning has been a lot of fun.  My crowning achievement so far:
a mad libs program!  It wasn't very fancy, but I thought it was neat.
I've also modded a rails tutorial in order to create an extremely ugly but
functional cookbook.</p>
